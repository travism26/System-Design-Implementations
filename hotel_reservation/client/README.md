# This will be the Server Side Rendering (SSR) of the hotel_reservation/client/README.md file

I am planning on focusing on the backend I am going to attempt to implement the frontend in a very basic way. So the styling will be basic and there might be some inefficiencies but I am welcome to feedback and create any issues if you see any.

I will fix them / accept any PRs people send my way.
